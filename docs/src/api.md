# API Reference

```@meta
CurrentModule = ParallelTestRunner
DocTestSetup = quote
    using ParallelTestRunner
end
```

## Main Functions

## Test Discovery

```

## Argument Parsing

filter_tests!
```

## Worker Management

## Custom Records

Per-test data is captured in an [`AbstractTestRecord`](@ref). The default
[`TestRecord`](@ref) stores timing and memory statistics; subtypes can wrap it
to collect additional data (e.g. GPU metrics) by dispatching [`execute`](@ref)
on the new type and reading the baseline through [`parent`](@ref).

```@docs
AbstractTestRecord
TestRecord
execute
parent(::ParallelTestRunner.AbstractTestRecord)
```

These are internal types or functions, not subject to semantic versioning contract (could be changed or removed at any point without notice), not intended for consumption by end-users.
They are documented here exclusively for `ParallelTestRunner` developers and contributors.
